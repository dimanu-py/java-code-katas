## Description

This repository contains examples that violate the SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle: Every class should have a single responsibility. A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- Open/Closed Principle: You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it. Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. Functions that use references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.â€¨â€¨ Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Objective

The objective is modify each of the examples in order to not violate the corresponding SOLID principle.
