Write a Spring Boot service to accomplish the following requirements:

- Given version 1 of a product that was deployed at date D1 with success
- And given version 2 of the same product that was deployed at date D1 with rollback
- When I fetch deployment history
- Then the deployment list contains these deployments:
    - v1:D1:success
    - v2:D1:rollback

## Objective

The objective with this exercise is to learn how to create an API
using Spring Boot and how to test it.

The kata will be developed using Outside-In TDD approach.
